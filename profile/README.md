# Cheetah Framework - GitHub Organization

Welcome to the **Cheetah** GitHub organization! Cheetah is an open-source ecosystem designed to help developers rapidly build backend services by automatically generating CRUD APIs based on simple configuration files. Our mission is to empower developers with powerful, flexible, and minimalistic frameworks to streamline backend development and reduce repetitive code.

## Overview

The **Cheetah** organization focuses on developing frameworks, tools, and libraries that make backend development faster, easier, and more efficient. Our flagship framework, the **Cheetah Framework**, is a lightweight Dart-based solution that automatically creates RESTful CRUD APIs using a simple schema configuration. Our tools are designed to be:

- **Fast**: Minimal overhead, focusing on rapid development and performance.
- **Declarative**: Simple configuration over complex code, with automatic endpoint generation.
- **Flexible**: Easily extendable for various use cases and adaptable to different backend environments.
- **Open-source**: Community-driven and fully open for contributions.

This organization houses various projects related to the Cheetah ecosystem, including the main framework, utilities, and integrations.
